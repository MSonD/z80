# Maud z80 simulator
This is a quirky z80 procesor simulator written in D. Uses dlangui for UI.
It has no support for IO or exception, though it could be easily implemented.
It currently only reads Intel Hexadecimal format.

To build, just run dub on base directory.

Written for an assignment. GAMS, for future reference.
